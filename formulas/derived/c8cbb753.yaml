assumptions:
- Enzyme follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics
- Temperature dependence of Vmax follows Arrhenius equation
- Temperature dependence of Km follows van't Hoff equation
- Single metabolic pathway dominates
- Enzyme structure remains stable within temperature range

category: derived
clinical_context: Use for TDM of drugs with saturable metabolism (Phenytoin, high-dose
  Aspirin, Ethanol) when patient has fever or hypothermia. Helps predict non-linear
  concentration changes with temperature.

derivation_steps:
- Load formula 'michaelis_menten' from textbook
- Load formula 'arrhenius_vmax' from textbook
- Load formula 'vanthoff_km' from textbook
- Substitute temperature-dependent Vmax into Michaelis-Menten
- Substitute temperature-dependent Km

- michaelis_menten
- arrhenius_vmax
- vanthoff_km
description: Temperature-corrected Michaelis-Menten equation combining non-linear
  pharmacokinetics with Arrhenius/van't Hoff temperature dependence. Models how enzyme
  saturation kinetics change with body temperature.
expression: C*V_max_ref*exp(E_a*(1/T_ref - 1/T)/R)/(C + K_m_ref*exp(Delta_H_m*(1/T_ref
  - 1/T)/R))
id: c8cbb753
limitations:
- Valid only for 32-42°C (enzyme denaturation outside range)
- Assumes single enzyme pathway
- Does not account for temperature effects on protein binding
- Requires experimental determination of Ea and ΔHm for each drug
